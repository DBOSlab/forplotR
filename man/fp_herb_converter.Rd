\arguments{
\item{herb_file_path}{File path of the herbarium empty template dataset.}

\item{language}{Language for output metadata. Default is "en", options are
"en", "pt" and "es".}

\item{herbarium_format}{Format of the herbarium dataset. Default is "jabot",
additional options is "brahms", "custom" herbarium format, where column names
must be specified by the user.}

\item{country}{Country where the data was collected. Default is "Brazil".}

\item{majorarea}{State where the data was collected.}

\item{minorarea}{Municipality where the data was collected.}

\item{protectedarea}{Name of the protected area (if applicable).}

\item{locnotes}{Notes of the locality where the data was collected.}

\item{project}{Project name or description (if applicable).}

\item{collector}{Main collector name. If \code{'NULL'}, extract the 'Team'
information of forestplots dataset. the first member of the team will be
considered as the main collector.}

\item{addcoll}{Character. Additional collector(s) name(s).If \code{'NULL'},
extract the additional members of the 'Team' in forestplots dataset.}

\item{lat}{Latitude in decimal degrees of the collection site.}

\item{long}{Longitude in decimal degrees of the collection site.}

\item{alt}{Altitude in meters of the collection site. If \code{'NULL'},
extract the altitude from geographic coordinates dataset.}

\item{add_census_notes}{If \code{'TRUE'}, census notes will be included in the
herbarium  sheet's notes. If \code{'FALSE'}, census notes will be omitted.}

\item{dir}{Pathway to the computer's directory, where the file will be saved.
The default is to create a directory named **Results_filled_herbarium_sheet**
and the search results will be saved within a subfolder named after the current
date.}

\value{
A data frame in herbarium format with the processed data from
forestplots dataset.

\description{
Function to process data collected in the \href{https://forestplots.net/}{Forestplots format}
and convert it into a herbarium format.
The default herbarium format is \href{https://rb.jbrj.gov.br/v2/validarplanilha_externo.php}{JABOT},
but it also supports conversion to the \href{https://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/brahms/support/conifers}{Brahms}
and custom herbarium formats, where the user can specify the column names in
column_map list. The function performs the following steps: (i) Reads the input
forestplots field sheet template and herbarium datasets; (ii) Ensures all
required metadata (e.g., majorarea, minorarea, lat, long) is correctly
provided;(iii) Processes taxonomic, spatial, and additional metadata to fill
the herbarium format sheet; (iv) Generates a new xlsx file with the converted
data, saved in a directory named after the current date.
This function automatically converts field codes from the Rainfor protocol
(e.g., tree condition codes and light exposure codes) into their full
descriptive meanings, and incorporates them into the final herbarium notes.
For example, the code "A" is converted to "alive normal" (or "Ã¡rvore viva
normal" in Portuguese). These translations are integrated into a standardized
descriptive text alongside other information extracted directly from the
forestplots sheet, such as DBH, field notes, and subplot coordinates.
For instance, a final note in English might read:

"Tree, 24.83cm DBH, with peeling bark, small buttress roots, bark with tiny
 reddish plates, crown completely exposed to vertical and lateral light in a
 45 degree curve. Individual #3 in the subplot 1, x = 1.5m, y = 2.5m."

The phrases "with peeling bark" and "crown completely exposed to vertical
and lateral light..." are automatically generated from the Rainfor codes,
while phrases such as "small buttress roots" and "bark with  reddish plates"
come from the original field notes recorded in the Forestplots sheet.The
conversion of Rainfor codes and the construction of this descriptive text
are supported in three languages: English, Portuguese, and Spanish, depending
on the value set in the `language` argument.
