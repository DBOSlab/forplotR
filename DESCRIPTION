Description: Provides tools for managing and visualizing forest plot data
    collected in the 'ForestPlots.net' format and related layouts, including
    field sheets, Query Library exports, and datasets from the MONITORA
    monitoring program. Functions generate static and interactive specimen
    maps, organize voucher image repositories based on updated taxonomy,
    fill herbarium spreadsheets (e.g., JABOT, BRAHMS) from field data,
    and export HTML maps with filters for taxonomy, collection status and
    image availability. Includes optional automated lookup of herbarium
    records from JABOT, with direct image links matched by collector and
    voucher number. The package also implements the 'plot_for_balance()'
    workflow to produce plot- and subplot-level PDF reports, species
    checklists, Excel summaries of collection completeness, and optional
    above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates per plot using 'BiomasaFP'.
