Description: Tools for managing and visualizing forest plot data collected in the ForestPlots format. Functions are provided to generate static and interactive specimen maps, organize voucher image directories based on updated taxonomy, fill herbarium spreadsheets (e.g., JABOT, BRAHMS) from field data, and export HTML maps with filters for taxonomy, collection status, and image availability. Designed to streamline post-collection workflows for field botanists and ecologists.
